# InternshipMatthieu



Here you can find the files I wrote for my internship.

*Probably the most important one ins RNPE_pipeline. It is the file in which I implemented the NPE / RNPE pipeline for the Gaussian Task and CS. 
* The others are mainly practicals. 
* ConditionalFlow: It is one of the "practical" I did during the first weeks of my internship with an easy conditionnal flow
* Model contains the example we used depending on the summary statistics (two observations, mean, mean of N observations, variance etc.).
